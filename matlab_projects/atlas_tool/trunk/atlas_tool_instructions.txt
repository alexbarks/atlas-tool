This is the atlas_tool instruction manual:

1. Need to compute WSS with 'Pims_postprocessing_tool'
   - SVN location: https://fsm1mqfns1/svn/main/matlab_projects/Pims_postprocessing_tool)
   - AJB Location: d:\research\matlabCode 
   - output is data_done (which will be used to compute the atlas, or heatmap)

2. The atlas_tool is used to create a probablity mask, geometry, and atlas from a number of patients
	- SVN location: https://fsm1mqfns1/svn/main/matlab_projects/atlas_tool/trunk
	- AJB location: d:\research\matlabCode 
	a. run make_geometry_point_cloud.m (make sure to select subject paths and set flirt folder location)
	   * when run make_geometry... make sure to change path when hit f5 (in order to have filrt work)
	   * AJB computer: flirt folder location is /cygdrive/d/research/matlabcode/matlab_registration/flirt/ (line 132, make sure to have file separation at the end)
	   * AJB computer: make sure line 159 has cygwin64 ('c:\cygwin64\bin\bash runflirt.sh')
	   * Also need to change lines: 369, 396 in a similar fashion as above
