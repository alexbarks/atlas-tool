To compute WSS via GUI interface:
- run 'heat_maps.m'
- saved data is under mrstruct folder and includes 
	o global WSS quantificaiton
	o WSS figure with quiver plot
	
To compute WSS in ~10 ROIs:
- run 'viewWSSverctors.m'
- not sure how saved

To compute WSS using MIP tool approach? (note that it doesn't compute WSS via the MIP rather it is only for viz)
- created for Kenichiro to do PA's; but also useful for tissue study
- run 'WSS_quantif_2views.m'
- saved data will be in  patient folder under 'regional masks'
	o projection images
	o masks
	o excel sheet with measurements

To compute heatmap
- run heat_maps and select 'Creation of heatmaps' 
	+ TODO get rid of traffic lights?
	o select atlas
	DONE hard code atlas selection for peak_systole (or 5 timesteps)
	+ TODO alex runs into error with calgary data bc of mrstruc_mask naming conventions (error line 294 heat_map_traffic_light_scalars_affine_registration) -- is this a one-off problem or systemic?
	o CALGARY: watch out for peak systole (note seems like Julio did peak systole)
	+ CALGARY: WARNING - need to perform segmentation uniformly (LVOT?), also watch out for registration errors
	+ HIERARCHY of QUALITY TODO: 
		1. agree on segmentation approach (include LVOT, etc)
			o make sure the code for creating the mask_struct_aorta is the same between sites
		2. use the correct atlas (systolic, 5 timesteps, age-matched)
		3. watch out for registration errors (create window for QA?)
		4. create a uniform report
	+ TODO: add in QA for rotation/coreg.
	+ TODO: reduce the number of output windows, consolidate saved data, also put rotation_translation.mat somewhere appropriate in the file system

This is a rough version of the atlas_tool instruction manual:


1. (Easy way to compute and register WSS: run 'atlas_batch.m' with everything uncommented) In essence this is doing the following:

	a) mimics_to_Wss(MrstructPath,MimicsSegPath,1,1,0,1,0,0,0)
		- THINGS TO CONSIDER (OR FIX) BEFORE RUNNING WSS ANALYSIS
			o viscosity (default value is 3.2cP)
			o size of inward facing normal (see hardcoded value under calculate_wss.m)
			
		- MrstructPath,MimicsSegPath are pulled from PATHNAME, which is formatted the following way:
			MrstructPath = strcat(PATHNAME{n},'\mrstruct\');
		    MimicsSegPath = strcat(PATHNAME{n},'\results_022\');
		
		- Pathname is the study folder for each individual subject, ie
			PATHNAME{1} = 'L:\data\NU\Aorta-4D_Flow\Results\Pim\Data\MIMICS\BAV_tissue\Controls\1_20120420_132106';
			PATHNAME{2} = 'L:\data\NU\Aorta-4D_Flow\Results\Pim\Data\MIMICS\BAV_tissue\Controls\2_20120426_132244';
		
		- note that output is saved uinder the mrStruct folder as 
			'mask_struct_aorta.mat'     - this is 0's and 1's where the mimics seg exists (this is the same as the output from mimics2ensight_tool)
			'Wss_struct_aorta.mat'      - this is the WSS in the matrix format, which can be input into ensight (if every timestep is calculated, which will happen if ensight flag is on)
			'Wss_point_cloud_aorta.mat' - This is the WSS point cloud (similar to the matrix, but more accurate, and used for the matlab analysis steps)

	b) [probability_mask] = make_geometry_point_cloud(PATHNAME,1,1);
		- output is the probability mask - note that this has already been chosen for the ideal threshold for the geometry (i.e. zeros and ones)
	c) [atlas] = make_atlas_point_cloud_scalars_affine_registration(PATHNAME,'',0,1,0,0)
	   [atlas] = make_atlas_point_cloud_scalars_affine_registration(PATHNAME,probability_mask,0,1,0,0)
		- this creates the atlas of velocity and WSS
	d) then atlas output from above needs to be saved

2. Things that can go wrong:
	a) need to make sure that rotation matrix is appropriately applied, this is not inherently obvious (to alex). Need to come up with some general guidelines to id failed registrations, etc. Watch out for peak systole switch. Alex thinks it doesn't work when user doesn't have permissions to write to the folder (see error below)
		
		Error using save_nii>write_nii (line 149)
		Cannot open file mask1.nii.

		Error in save_nii (line 83)
		write_nii(nii, filetype, fileprefix, old_RGB);

		Error in heat_map_traffic_light_scalars_affine_registration (line 510)
		save_nii(cnii,'mask1.nii');
		
	b) Also watch for the fact that you need to have the flirt and cygwin locations working (Alex has noted where they exist on his computer
	
	   * flirt folder  /cygdrive/d/research/matlabcode/matlab_registration/flirt/ (make sure to have file separation at the end)
	   
	   * cygwin64 'c:\cygwin64\bin\bash runflirt.sh'
	   
		
CALCULATION OF A HEATMAP (if have already computed an atlas previously)
1. compute WSS using 'mimics_to_Wss.m'
   * example usage (note have to simplify mrstruct naming so it will work with step 2):
	mimics_to_Wss('c:\_ensightCases\bav_tissue\poetzinger_PT447\mrstruct\','c:\_ensightCases\bav_tissue\poetzinger_PT447\results_user009\',1,1,1,1,0,0,0)
	
2. Compute heatmap via heat_map_traffic_light_scalars_affing_registration.m 
	* make sure to run in the correct folder or will get the error about 'Cannot open file mask1.nii'
	  (seems to work when I run it from the patient folder)
	 heat_map_traffic_light_scalars_affine_registration('l:\cv_mri\Aorta-4D_Flow\Results\Pim\Data\MIMICS\BAV_tissue\Controls','c:\_ensightCases\bav_tissue\poetzinger_PT447\',1,0,0,0,1)
	
	* can also run just as a command, but watch out for the systoleFlag (set to 1 if no inputs)
