This is a rough version of the atlas_tool instruction manual:


1. (Easy way to compute and register WSS: run 'atlas_batch.m' with everything uncommented) In essence this is doing the following:

	a) mimics_to_Wss(MrstructPath,MimicsSegPath,1,1,0,1,0,0,0)
		- MrstructPath,MimicsSegPath are pulled from PATHNAME, which is formatted the following way:
			MrstructPath = strcat(PATHNAME{n},'\mrstruct\');
		    MimicsSegPath = strcat(PATHNAME{n},'\results_022\');
		- Pathname is the study folder for each individual subject, ie
			PATHNAME{1} = 'L:\data\NU\Aorta-4D_Flow\Results\Pim\Data\MIMICS\BAV_tissue\Controls\1_20120420_132106';
			PATHNAME{2} = 'L:\data\NU\Aorta-4D_Flow\Results\Pim\Data\MIMICS\BAV_tissue\Controls\2_20120426_132244';
		- note that output is saved uinder the mrStruct folder as 
			'mask_struct_aorta.mat'     - this is 0's and 1's where the mimics seg exists (this is the same as the output from mimics2ensight_tool)
			'Wss_struct_aorta.mat'      - this is the WSS in the matrix format, which can be input into ensight (if every timestep is calculated, which will happen if ensight flag is on)
			'Wss_point_cloud_aorta.mat' - This is the WSS point cloud (similar to the matrix, but more accurate, and used for the matlab analysis steps)
	b) [probability_mask] = make_geometry_point_cloud(PATHNAME,1,1);
		- output is the probability mask - note that this has already been chosen for the ideal threshold for the geometry (i.e. zeros and ones)
	c) [atlas] = make_atlas_point_cloud_scalars_affine_registration(PATHNAME,'',0,1,0,0)
	   [atlas] = make_atlas_point_cloud_scalars_affine_registration(PATHNAME,probability_mask,0,1,0,0)
		- this creates the atlas of velocity and WSS
	d) then atlas output from above needs to be saved

2. Things that can go wrong:
	a) need to make sure that rotation matrix is appropriately applied, this is not inherently obvious (to alex). Need to come up with some general guidelines to id failed registrations, etc. Watch out for peak systole switch. 
	
	b) Also watch for the fact that you need to have the flirt and cygwin locations working (Alex has noted where they exist on his computer
	   * flirt folder  /cygdrive/d/research/matlabcode/matlab_registration/flirt/ (make sure to have file separation at the end)
	   * cygwin64 'c:\cygwin64\bin\bash runflirt.sh'
	   
	
	
CALCULATION OF A HEATMAP (if have already computed an atlas previously)
1. compute WSS using 'mimics_to_Wss.m'
   * example usage (note have to simplify mrstruct naming so it will work with step 2):
	mimics_to_Wss('c:\_ensightCases\bav_tissue\poetzinger_PT447\mrstruct\','c:\_ensightCases\bav_tissue\poetzinger_PT447\results_user009\',1,1,1,1,0,0,0)
	
2. Compute heatmap via heat_map_traffic_light_scalars_affing_registration.m 
	* make sure to run in the correct folder or will get the error about 'Cannot open file mask1.nii'
	  (seems to work when I run it from the patient folder)
	 heat_map_traffic_light_scalars_affine_registration('l:\cv_mri\Aorta-4D_Flow\Results\Pim\Data\MIMICS\BAV_tissue\Controls','c:\_ensightCases\bav_tissue\poetzinger_PT447\',1,0,0,0,1)
	
	* can also run just as a command, but watch out for the systoleFlag (set to 1 if no inputs)
